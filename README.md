# MIPR
Modular Intelligent Programmable Robot

MIPR is a robot designed to get people into coding and engineering. The code from this library is designed to be used with the tutorials over at l33t.uk/MIPR. 
The code evolves over the tutorials becoming more complex as the tutorials progress. 

To view the tutorials that go with this code go to www.L33T.uk/MIPR and my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO2D4fDkIZCW84YAnwynvHjhJKvkYOL5g

Now these tutorials are complete I'm starting work on MIPR Nano. This new robot will be based on MIPR however, it will use an Arduino Nano compatiable with both this generation of Nano 33 devices and the previous generation of revsion 3 Nano's. It will come in kit form made for you soldered onto printed circuit boards. It will have the same form factor with even more features using through hole components and a manual including circuit diagrams making it hackable encurraging makers to create their own sensor boards.
  
Happy coding.
