# MIPR
Modular Intelligent Programmable Robot

MIPR is a robot designed to get people into coding and engineering. The code from this library is designed to be used with the tutorials over at l33t.uk/MIPR. 
The code evolves over the tutorials becoming more complex as the tutorials progress. 

To view the tutorials that go with this code go to www.L33T.uk/MIPR and my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO2D4fDkIZCW84YAnwynvHjhJKvkYOL5g
  
Happy coding.
