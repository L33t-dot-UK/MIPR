# MIPR
Modular Intelligent Programmable Robot

MIPR is a robot designed to get people into coding and engineering. The code from this library is designed to be used with the tutorials over at l33t.uk. The code evolves over the tutorials becoming more complex as the tutorials progress. 

For a completed implementation of code for MIPR download the finished MIPR library from <INSERT LINK HERE> rather than using this code that is designed to be used with the tutorials.
  
  Happy coding.
