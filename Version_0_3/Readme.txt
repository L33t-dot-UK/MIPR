Once the code is uploaded to MIPR use Telemetry.jar and open the layout named SB001_TEL_A
Once loaded this layout will try to connect to your robot and fail. If it fails select the
correct comm port for your system and the correct baud rate then press connect. Once
connected you should see telemetry data as shown in the You Tube video; https://youtu.be/HkoHo65-CrE

Multilpe .ino files are used to order the code in Arduino IDE each .ino file will have a different funciton.
